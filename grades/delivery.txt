Demo
-------------

Everyone was dressed professionally, were all very articulate.

Talked very technical to Bill, who seemed to be very interested in that.

Worked through everything very well -- no real technical difficulties.

Seemed well prepared for everything that was thrown at you.

Great job!

Administrator Manual
------------

Mostly looks good -- the installation should have covered actually installing
your PHP software from the ground up, even if that just includes copying the
files to where they need to go.  Otherwise good.

Grade: 95/100
